## Module Objective

The primary objective for this module is to have students understand the respective strengths and weaknesses of the two main data collection methods used in research on primate behavior, focal bout sampling and instantaneous scan sampling.

## Learning Objectives
1.	Collect data using both methods
2. Define their own ethnogram and apply it in data collection
3. Analyze visualizations of thedata in order to enrich class discussion

## Module Description 
Anthropologists interpret interactions that exist between primates and their environments and between primates themselves through the lens of natural and sexual selection to draw conclusions about primate behacior and sociality.  In field work with primates, there are two main methods of data collection _focal bout sampling_ and _instantaneous scan sampling_.  The purpose of the module is to have students understand the respective strengths and weaknesses of these methods.   
### Data
Students collect data by coding labeled footage from a basketball game using the two sampling methods.

Platform
Students use Excel to process and analyze the data.
